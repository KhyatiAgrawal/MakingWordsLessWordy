This is my Spring 2019 Independent Work

The project abstract is as follows:
Verbosity in written language is undesirable in many contexts, especially in scientific or academic writing.
Adhering to the word limits, and presenting the information in a succinct manner is a challenge for many new learners, college students 
and experts of the language alike. 
The goal of my project is to adopt a Machine Translation approach to suggest improvements for verbose sentences in a piece of text.
Modern approaches in Machine Translation involve training a recurrent Neural Network, or a Transformer network, and for this task, 
translation would mean conversion from English to English itself. 
A model for generating succinct sentences without losing details, simply by reordering, substituting and generating better structured 
sentences is a task analogous to translation, and it could have a lot of utility in improving technical and argumentative pieces of 
writing (for example: short papers, journals articles and scientific papers). It could help an author shorten and simplify his work 
without worrying about losing details in the shortening process. The model, if effective, could be scaled for translating between 
regional and historic differences in English language itself; A similar translation approach could be used to represent 
Shakespearean language, and styles of other authors in readable present dialect, again while ensuring preservation of details. 
(For example: “Lend me your years” -Julius Caesar, Shakespeare could be translated to “Hear me out”)
