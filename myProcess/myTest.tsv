In those countries where dialect study is undertaken, dialectologists observe that there are today many factors militating against the strict maintenance of older dialect boundaries: the standardization of terminology as adopted by national periodicals, news services, radio, and television; the establishment of prestige dialects and, through the media, their promulgation; and the huge population shifts that have taken place, particularly in the U.S. since WWII. Such shifts have been somewhat slower in England, but seem now to be speeding up. 	 Dialectologists observe that there are many factors militating against the strict maintenance of older dialect boundaries: terminology standardization as adopted throughout mass media; establishment and enforcement of prestige dialects; and huge population shifts, particularly in the U.S. since WWII and recently England.
